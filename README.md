## Tools Used
#### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
#### [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Read before you contribute

### Contexts
The application is built around a series of Contexts (See [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) in conjunction with [HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) to provide different data to different components across the appliacation.

The following Contexts are available:

- [Metamask](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Go.app/tree/develop/components/MetamaskContext/index.js)
- [Blockchain](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Go.app/tree/develop/components/BlockchainContext.js)
- [Kyber](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Go.app/tree/develop/components/KyberContext.js)
- [Notifications](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Go.app/tree/develop/components/NotificationsContext.js)
- [Civic](https://github.com/MyBitFoundation/MyBit-Go.app/tree/develop/components/UI/CivicContext.js)

So if you need any of the information inside these contexts you can use the `with` high order component each of them provides.

### File Structure

### Patterns

### Styling

As said previously we use Styled Components but we also use a set of standards and a way to style inside the application. You will notice some of our files don't yet follow these standards, refactoring is gradually being done, these decisions were made recently.

#### Theme provider
We use Styled Components [Theme Provider](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) component to have access to our own theme properties. See [this](https://github.com/csmartinsfct/MyBit-Go.app/blob/hotfix/refactoring/components/Theme/index.js) file with the declaration and an example of using it [here](https://github.com/csmartinsfct/MyBit-Go.app/blob/hotfix/refactoring/components/MobileMenu/styledMobileMenuWrapper.js).

#### Standards for naming
Each styled component is ideally declared inside its own file and for this reason the name of that file, say you are customising a button and your component is call `Navbar`then this new styled component file would be named `navBarButton.js`. So you keep the name of the Main component attached to each styled component file used inside it.

In this case the main styled component `Navbar` could be declared in a different file using `navBarWrapper.js` and then used inside `/NavBar/index.js` like so: ´<NavBarWrapper>´.

So the folder structure would be:
```
NavBar/index.js
NavBar/navBarWrapper.js
NavBar/navBarButton.js
```
<br/>

index.js:
```
<NavBarWrapper>
   <NavBarButton>
     Hello
  </NavBarButton>
</NavBarWrapper>
```

#### Standards for writing css
We use a mobile first approach. See more about it [here](https://zellwk.com/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css/).

See [this](https://itnext.io/thinking-in-styled-components-e230ea37c52c) document as a good reference on thinking in Styled Components.
