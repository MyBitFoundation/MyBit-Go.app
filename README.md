### Installing the dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/usage)
```sh
yarn
```
### Development server
```sh
yarn start
```

### DApp [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)
Storybook is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

##### Exporting the Storybook

```sh
npm run build-storybook
```

This will generate the required files so that the storybook can be deployed as a static application. It exports the files to a directory named ".out".

##### Starting the Storybook

Once that is done, you can 
```sh
npm run storybook
```
and it will run the development server on your local machine, and give you a URL to browse through the stories.
