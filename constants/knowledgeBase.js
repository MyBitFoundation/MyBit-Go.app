  question: 'Investors',
  answer: 'Contribute funds to various asset listings on the explore page. If fully funded, they are allocated a tokenized ownership stake in the asset proportionate to their contribution, which entitles them to a proportionate revenue stream from the asset.',
}, {
  question:  'Asset Managers',

}, {
  question: 'IoT Partners',
  answer: 'Supply IoT assets to the ecosystem. These can be things like Bitcoin ATM, 3D printers, Self-driving cars/trucks, storage units, co-working spaces etc. These assets are funded by investors and begin to generate revenue by providing services to the economy.',

const sectionFees = [{
  question: 'Investors',
  answer: 'Assets are assessed a 3% fee on their total value. 1% goes to the MyBit DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation) – this is to power the MyBIt ecosystem and sustain inbound contributions and maintenance. 1% goes to the MyBit Treasury – this is to maintain the MyBit Foundation which oversees the MyBit Go product and manages business operations. And 1% is used to buyback and burn MYB, removing them from the total supply total supply – this supports token value growth through organically increasing demand. Furthermore, MyBit Go keeps 1% of ownership of listed assets, or in the case of community driven operators, this ownership is provided to the community member that onboarded the operator.',
}, {
  question:  'IoT Partners',
  answer: 'Partners who only accept fiat in exchange for their assets will charge an 8% fee on transactions. This is not taken as profit by MyBit Go or not a value addition to the MyBit ecosystem, but is purely due to the third party fees associated with crypto-fiat.',

Additionally, smart contracts ensure that terms are followed as defined in the contract. Lastly, it automatically records ownership in a ledger without single point of failure risk.',
}, {
  question: 'Why Ethereum?',
  answer: 'Nothing compares. Other Blockchains may have increased speed or lower fees, but they do so by sacrificing security. Since MyBit Go is a financial technology platform, security is of the utmost concern.',

}, {
  question: 'What if my transaction did not go through?',

  question: 'How long are assets available for funding?',
  answer: 'A maximum of thirty (30) days, or until the funding goal is reached.',
}, {
  question: 'What if the asset isn’t fully funded?',
  answer: 'Contributed funds are sent back in DAI via smart contract at the end of the 30 day funding period.',
}, {
  question: 'Crypto is volatile, how does that impact investors?',
  answer: 'The total funding is always constant in US Dollars. We implement DAI, a stable coin created by Marker DAO to remove volatility risk by automatically converting all cryptocurrencies as they are contributed.',
}, {
  question: 'Slippage using Kyber',
  answer: 'Kyber is an automated token exchange protocol that enables multi-currency support on MyBit Go. In automatic trading platforms like Kyber, slippage occurs algorithmically through utilising liquidity pools to maintain price equilibrium. This provides a more stable alternative to traditional trading platforms in which slippage occurs erratically through buy/sell price and volume differentials. Like traditional exchanges, slippage increases with the volume of orders, and can do so dramatically. In such cases it is the responsibility of users to monitor the slippage rate and accept the fees.',

}, {
  question: 'What types of assets are listed?',
  answer: 'Any  revenue generating digital or hardware asset whose income can be measured through the digital or IoT economy.',

  answer: 'Asset managers are paid a fraction of the total asset revenue as it is generated.',
}, {
  question: 'How is asset manager collateral calculated?',
  anchor: true,
  answer: <React.Fragment>Asset collateral is standardised based on payment channels of asset management and asset manager history as described below.<br /><br />

Based on Asset Manager History:<br />
0-4 Assets - 35% collateral<br />
5-9 Assets - 25%<br />
10-24 Assets 20%<br />
25+ Assets: 10%<br />
<br />
Additional components:<br />
If asset manager has to receive funds from fundraise to purchase the asset:<br />
Add 100% collateral.<br />
<br />
If fiat is received and has to be converted into crypto to pay investors? Then, multiply asset manager history collateral by 3x.<br />
<br />
Example 1: It's my first asset, all fiat, (this would be a max collateral scenario)<br />
(35%x3) + 100% = 205% collateral<br />
<br />
Example 2: 5th asset, payment in fiat, payout in crypto<br />
<br />
25% + 100% = 125%<br />
<br />
Example 3: 10th asset, payment in crypto, payout in fiat<br />
<br />
(20%x3) = 60%<br />
<br />
Example 4: 30th asset, payment and payout in crypto, (lowest collateral scenario)<br />

= 10%<br />
</React.Fragment>
}, {
  question: 'How are asset managers selected?',
  answer: 'Anyone can be an asset manager by completing the verification steps and having an asset funded on the platform. Investors personally select the assets they perceive to have the best asset managers and asset situation. This can be assessed by fees, asset manager history and credentials, supporting documents surrounding asset due diligence etc.',
}, {
  question: 'What if asset managers perform poorly?',
  answer: 'Asset managers are able to be voted out by consensus of asset investor capital weight. Additionally, they post a large collateral payment at the start of the listing process which is payed back to them incrementally. If they fail to oversee the asset correctly their collateral is at risk of being burned. These factors, along with reputation, serve as powerful incentives to carry out the role correctly.',
