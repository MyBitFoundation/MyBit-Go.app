        Make a backup of your private key and password. DO NOT just
        store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or
        save it to a USB drive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location.
        A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood
        along with your laptop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other
        cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will
        be stolen.
