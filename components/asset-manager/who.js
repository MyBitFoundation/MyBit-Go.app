      Anyone who passes identity verification is eligible to be an Asset Manager.

    <CarouselSlideParagraph>
      Once approved, you have the right to be an Asset Manager for life.
    </CarouselSlideParagraph>
    <CarouselSlideParagraph>
      However, this does not guarantee an income for life.

    <CarouselSlideParagraph>
      After being appointed, everything is based on trust.
    </CarouselSlideParagraph>
    <CarouselSlideParagraph>
      That is, the more assets you manage successfully, the better your trust rating.
    </CarouselSlideParagraph>
    <CarouselSlideParagraph>
      If you act badly, you will still be an Asset Manager, but investors may not fund
      your assets. In rare situations, you may be banned from the platform.
