      <li>
        Coordinating any local approval required and/or navigating regulations
        (e.g. getting approval from a store owner to place a Crypto ATM in their store).
      </li>
      <li>
        Listing assets: only Asset Managers have the power to initiate new funding campaigns for assets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oversight and maintenance: the Asset Manager is in charge of overseeing the asset
        and ensuring it functions properly. This may include security, repairs, marketing,
        or replenishing funds in the case of a Crypto ATM.
